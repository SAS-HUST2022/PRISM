## Dataset Statistics

This is the statistics of the two datasets. We counted the number of Stars, Forks, Commits, Pull Requests, Code Lines(LOC), Tags and Release Versions of all the projects. 

We select 51 Java projects to build the first dataset, and top 20 Java projects to build the second dataset. 

To find the original repo for the 2nd dataset, see:
